Hi Hassan, I'm also interested in natural language processing. Who is your Ph.D. advisor?\\
I looked at the link you provided above. I find the idea really interesting. I liked the synthesis of news to a smaller amount.  There are other services that offer that for news. How do you imagine this could be used, and in how many fields? -- Ken Lee
