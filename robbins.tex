\section{Wes Robbins}
I am in the master's in computer science program at UCCS. My research area is in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Biometrics. In particular, I am working on improving biometric robustness in challenging imaging conditions. My goals for this course are to improve my understanding of the process of research and improve my ability to execute high-quality research. 

\section{Repo link}
A repository related to my research is \textit{insightface},
which can be found at\newline \url{https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface}. \\
This repository has code for a number of research problems related face biometrics such as face detection, face alignment, and face recognition. The well maintained over the last several years and includes code for 7 papers that have been published at computer vision conferences.
