\section{Introduction:}

I am Minhajul Alam Rahat, a second-year PhD student at the UCCS CS department. My research focus is on embedded system security. Specifically, I am interested in device firmware vulnerability analysis. I am an enthusiast of technology and knowledge. I like practical problem-solving and innovation. I want to contribute to society through my research work in the future. I look forward to working in academia to continue my research work in the future and, at the same time, help students become good researchers.
I look forward to learning research methodologies in a more systematic approach while doing the CS 6000 course. I believe that it will help me broaden my thinking while trying to devise a plan or methodology to solve a problem. This course will also help me read research papers efficiently and hone my skills in using different tools for my research work. I have already met several creative and skilled research people in the class, and I am excited to share our ideas and passions for research. I hope to understand how other people in the research community are doing research in their respective fields.

\section{Related Code:}

I am working in firmware binary analysis techniques. One of the work related to my topic is Firmalice. Firmalice is a binary firmware analysis framework. It is based on a symbolic execution engine which can find authentication bypass flaws in embedded device firmware. Link to the code for this framwork:

\section{Questions:}
\subsection{01: What are the limitations of achieving this goal as you need sufficient data and also bytecode analysis is sometimes hard?}
