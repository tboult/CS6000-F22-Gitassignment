\section{Introduction - Katrina Rosemond}

Hello, my name is Katrina Rosemond. I am a 3rd year Ph.D. computer science 
student at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS). As a 
research assistant in the Embedded Systems Security Lab (ESSL), my 
research focuses on cyber-physical system (CPS) security, particularly 
automotive security. I earned my bachelor's degree in electrical 
engineering from NC A\&T State University. However, I found a passion for 
hardware and software, leading me to pursue a computer science graduate 
degree.

By enrolling in CS 6000, I aim to improve my research skills and 
understand who I am as a researcher. While I have been contributing to 
research projects since undergrad, I still struggle when I lead my 
projects. Mainly when writing, I never knew how much writing was involved 
when I first started in tech. So when I have to write a paper, I struggle 
with determining what's a good paper, pulling out the necessary 
information, and delivering that information on paper. But I know that the 
more I practice, the more I become comfortable with something. Therefore, 
I hope that between the lessons and assignments in CS 6000, I will learn 
to become a better scientific writer and more comfortable when I need to 
write a research paper.

\section{Git Repo}
The synCAN git repo \url{https://github.com/etas/SynCAN} is a synthetic 
controller area network (CAN) dataset used for CAN intrusion detection 
systems (IDSs). I'm currently researching the quality of CAN IDS datasets.
